# Example notebooks using different sources of csv

This repository contains examples of visualizing different open datasets in csv format with matplotlib in jupyter notebooks. It is meant to illustrate how skills learnt in the exercises with particle physics open data from the CMS experiment (https://github.com/cms-opendata-education) can be applied in many other domains.

Capability of making colourful plots does not, however, make anyone an expert. These examples should not be misunderstood as a claim that anyone can become a scientist just by drawing some plots or histograms. Understanding the phenomena behind the data and and the details of data collection require years of studies in any of the domains addressed in these examples.

These notebooks are just some very simple amateur examples of the various kind data which have been picked up rather randomly from different sources. Admittedly, it has been a great pleasure to discover and apply my new skills as a new-comer in python and jupyter notebooks. Claiming no expertise in any of the domains presented in these examples, it is thrilling to be able to handle data from various sources, and treat data with some relevance to me, like population statistic in my home town, or the data produced by the devices that I use for my leasure time.

Have fun with data!
